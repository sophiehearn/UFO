# UFO Sightings

## Overview of the Project 

Here we developed a webpage to display data on UFO sightings to help citizen scientists understand the truth about UFOs and potential alien life forms in the Universe. While we can't speak to the validity or source of the dataset, the webpage functionality provides ample opportunity for the user to dig through the data and determine their own thoughts about these sightings.

## Results

In order to provide the user with adequate search functionality, this interactive webpage offers five search filters, which can be used independently or together to filter out sightings relevant to specific dates, cities, states, countries, and even shapes.

Initially the user sees a chart with the entire dataset:

Once a search term is entered, the dataset is filtered to reflect that term:

Another search term can be added for more precise filtering.

The full dataset will show again if filters are cleared. 

## Summary 

Although this dataset does have a wide variety of search features, there are some drawback and additional features that could be added. For example, the "date" search is limited to the specific day in question. UFO enthusiasts might be interested in determining how many sightings there are in a given year or month. It could also be useful to see the same month in multiple years, e.g. do our alien brethren have a penchant for visiting us every April? Finally, although this would require quite a lot of additional work on the back end, an interesting addition might be providing the historical weather data on the date in question. Could some of these sightings be explained by consistent weather phenomena? If not, that could provide even more evidence for the doubters among us.
